                    <h2>Meaning of On-Nūm Meditation Center</h2>
                     <p>In 2018, Most Venerable Phra Prommongkol Vi (Most Ven. Ajarn Tong Sirimangalo visited Lieberose and named the meditation center at Lieberose, Markt 8. The Thai name he gave to the center is as follows:
                     
                        <p>สำนัก = "sǎmnág" = "center", "place" or "office"
                        <p>ปฏิบัติธรรม = "bpàdtìbàt taam" = "to practice the teaching of the Buddha" or "to practice meditation"
                        <p>อ่อนนุ่ม = "òn-nûm" = "young", "fresh" or "new" (as in for e.g., a fresh fruit or vegetable)
                    <p>On Nūm Meditation Center means a place for spiritual renewal by practice of the Buddha's teaching. It represents an opportunity to acknowledge and let go of the past to make room for new and beautiful things to grow. The meaning "young" also conincides with the last name of the founders of the center, Miriam Young and Alex Young.
                    <h2>History of Lieberose, Markt 8</h2>
                    <p>Alice Lewkowicz was the daughter of a Jewish couple who lived in Lieberose in east Germany about 120 km South East of Berlin. Until Alice was 12 years old they lived in a large house at 8 Market Street. Because of the holocaust, Alice's parents packed her a suit case with photographs and family mementos knowing that they would never see her again and sent her to Israel alone. They did not survive the war and we have never discovered what exactly happened to them.</p>
                    <p>After arriving in Israel, Alice eventually married and she and her husband decided to move to Canada. Decades later in the late 1980s, the Berlin wall came down and an English lawyer started helping Jews whose families had property in the region, to reclaim it back from the German government. He placed an ad in a Canadian newspaper. Alice contacted the lawyer to see if she could get her house back. Amazingly, she did and the house at 8 Market Street was returned to her.</p>
                    <p> Unfortunately, the house was in very bad condition and Alice didn't have the money to fix it up. She chose not to sell the house even though most of the other Jews who got their property back chose to sell. Miriam and Alex then decided to go and ask  Most Venerable Phra Prommongkol Vi (Most Ven. Ajarn Tong Sirimangalo) what to do with the house and he said to them, "Keep that house as a meditation centre".</p>
                    <p>When Alice died in 2014, Miriam and Alex told Miriam’s family that they would take the house and try to follow the advice of Most Venerable Phra Prommongkol Vi (Most Ven. Ajarn Tong Sirimangalo). In 2018, Alex and Miriam finally completed all the German inheritance paper work and the house was transferred to them. A few weeks later, they were surprised to get a call from Ajarn Thanat saying that Most Venerable Phra Prommongkol Vi (Most Ven. Ajarn Tong Sirimangalo) was going to Germany and wanted to visit the house in Lieberose. He went with several monks and did a blessing ceremony at the house. At this time, Alex and Miriam are planning to hold a retreat at the house following minor renovations that must first be completed.
